Quickstart

    | This section contains a walkthrough of the basic functionality of Nertivia4PY.
    | It assumes you have already installed the library, if you haven't please read the installation instructions.

Examples

    | Find a list of all the example bots and code snippits in the github repo or from the link below.
    | Or you can follow the steps below to create your first bot.
    | Examples: https://github.com/bentettmar/nertivia4py/tree/main/examples

'''''''''''''
A minimal bot
'''''''''''''
    | Lets make a bot that responds to the command ``!ping`` with ``Pong!``
    |

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: example_bot.py
        :name: example_bot-py

        import nertivia4py

        bot = nertivia4py.Bot("!")

        @bot.event
        def on_ready(event):
            print("Bot is ready!")

        @bot.command(name="ping")
        def ping(msg):
            msg.channel.send("Pong!")

        bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")

    | 1. First we import the library.
    | 2. Then we create an instance of nertivia4py.Bot_.
    .. _nertivia4py.Bot: /docs/bot.html
    | 3. We then define a function that will be called when the bot is ready using the ``on_ready`` event.
    | 4. We then define a command that will respond to the command ``!ping`` with ``Pong!``.
    | 5. Finally we run the bot using the ``run`` method.
    |
    | If all goes well you should see the bot respond to the command ``!ping`` with ``Pong!`` in your chat.
